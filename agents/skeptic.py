"""Skeptic: challenges specialist claims the cited evidence does not support.

Reads `case_file.evidence`, `case_file.suspect_profiles`, and
`case_file.timeline`. Writes only `case_file.skeptic_reviews`, appending one
`SkepticReview` per call. A required citation and citing only existing
evidence IDs are already enforced when each specialist parses its own
output; the Skeptic's job is to also challenge claims whose cited evidence
does not actually establish the stated conclusion.

    "cites an evidence ID absent from the case file. Do not flag a claim "
